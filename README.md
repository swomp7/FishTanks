FishTanks is an educational experience that immerses users of the already popularized game Minecraft in learning about the importance and logistics of caring for aquarium life, all done through complex code and a new form of system that does not yet exist in the base game. It was created to help solve the issue of people not knowing how to care for fish upon purchasing them as pets, as well as the lack of fish tank mods already available in Minecraft.
